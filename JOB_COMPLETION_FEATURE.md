# Job Completion Feature

## Overview

This feature allows technicians to complete jobs directly from the job detail page. The implementation follows the backend API specification for job completion.

## Implementation Details

### Backend API Integration

- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /v1/jobs/{jobId}/complete`
- **Authentication**: Required (Technician only)
- **Method**: `jobService.completeJob(jobId: string)`

### Frontend Implementation

#### Files Modified:

1. **`src/services/jobService.ts`**

   - Added `completeJob()` method
   - Handles API call to `/v1/jobs/{jobId}/complete`
   - Returns job and technician data after completion

2. **`src/pages/JobProfile/JobProfile.tsx`**

   - Added "Complete Job" button for technicians
   - Integrated with user authentication state
   - Added toast notifications for success/error feedback
   - Added loading state during completion

3. **`src/pages/JobProfile/JobProfile.scss`**
   - Added styles for the complete job button
   - Responsive design with hover effects
   - Disabled state styling

#### Key Features:

1. **Access Control**

   - Only technicians can see the "Complete Job" button
   - Button only appears if technician is assigned to the job
   - Job must not be already completed

2. **Business Rules Validation**

   - Job status must be "Scheduled" or "Pending"
   - Job due date must be today's date
   - Technician must be assigned to the job

3. **User Experience**

   - Loading state during completion
   - Toast notifications for success/error
   - Button is disabled during completion
   - Job status updates immediately after completion

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network error handling
   - API error message display
   - Graceful fallback for failed completions

### Usage

#### For Technicians:

1. Navigate to a job detail page (`/jobs/{jobId}`)
2. If the job is assigned to you and due today, you'll see a "Complete Job" button
3. Click the button to complete the job
4. A success toast will appear confirming completion
5. The job status will update to "Completed"

#### Button Visibility Conditions:

```typescript
user?.userType === "technician" &&
  jobData?.technician?.id === user.id &&
  job.status !== "Completed" &&
  (job.status === "Scheduled" || job.status === "Pending") &&
  new Date(job.dueDate).toDateString() === new Date().toDateString();
```

### API Response Handling

The complete job API returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Job completed successfully",
  "data": {
    "job": {
      /* updated job details */
    },
    "technician": {
      /* updated technician info */
    },
    "completionDetails": {
      "completedAt": "2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
      "completedBy": {
        /* technician info */
      },
      "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Cases Handled:

- Job not found (404)
- Job not assigned to technician (403)
- Job already completed (400)
- Wrong due date (400)
- Invalid job status (400)
- Network errors

### Testing

To test the feature:

1. Login as a technician
2. Navigate to a job assigned to you with today's due date
3. Verify the "Complete Job" button appears
4. Click the button and verify success toast
5. Verify job status updates to "Completed"

### Debug Information

The component includes debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:

```typescript
console.log("Job Profile Debug:", {
  userType: user?.userType,
  userId: user?.id,
  technicianId: technician?.id,
  jobStatus: job.status,
  dueDate: job.dueDate,
  isDueToday: new Date(job.dueDate).toDateString() === new Date().toDateString(),
  canComplete: /* boolean condition */
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confirmation Modal**: Add a confirmation dialog before completing jobs
2. **Completion Notes**: Allow technicians to add completion notes
3. **Photo Upload**: Allow technicians to upload completion photos
4. **Time Tracking**: Track actual completion time vs estimated time
5. **Bulk Completion**: Allow completing multiple jobs at once
